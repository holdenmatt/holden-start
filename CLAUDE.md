# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸ“š Onboarding

At the start of each session, read:
1. Any `**/README.md` docs across the project
2. Any `**/README.*.md` docs across the project

## âœ… Quality Gates

When writing code, Claude must not finish until all of these succeed:

1. `pnpm type-check`
2. `pnpm lint`
3. `pnpm format:check`
4. All unit tests (`pnpm test:run`) pass

If any step fails, fix the issues and run checks again.
